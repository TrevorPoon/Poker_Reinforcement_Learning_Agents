# Poker Reinforcement Learning Agents

This machine learning project is designed to uncover optimal strategies for playing poker, with a primary focus on Texas Hold'emâ€”the most popular variant of the game. The project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning algorithms and their practical applications in game theory and decision-making under uncertainty.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a robust AI poker player capable of competing against human players and other AI opponents. By leveraging hand-crafted feature extraction, state-of-the-art machine learning models, and rigorous training/testing procedures, this project delves deep into the complex and fascinating world of poker strategy.

The repository is organized into several vital components:

- `Models/`: Contains the trained machine learning models.
- `my_players/`: Houses the bot logic and decision-making algorithms.

## Features

- **Advanced Feature Extraction**: A sophisticated system for processing the game state, distilling vital information such as normalized stack sizes, hole card strengths, and pot sizes to inform AI decisions.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Machine learning models developed with PyTorch are integrated to determine the best course of action given the current game situation.
- **Optimized Strategy**: Through rigorous training, the AI players adjust their strategies to maximize expected value and adopt the most effective tactics against a wide range of opponents.
- **Simulated Testing Environment**: Comprehensive testing frameworks to evaluate AI performance against various playstyles and scenarios.
